## Microservices Breakdown

1. Authentication Service

        Handles user signup/login

        JWT-based authentication

        Role-based access (Admin, Member, Guest)

        Session management (optional Redis support)

        Password reset, email verification (optional)

        Tech Suggestion: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis (for sessions)

👥 2. User & Team Management Service

        Create and manage teams

        Invite/join users

        Manage user profile, avatar

        List team members

        Tech Suggestion: Express + PostgreSQL

🧵 3. Messaging Service (with Thread Support)

        Send/receive messages in real-time

        Threaded replies (via parent_message_id)

        Message editing & deletion

        Seen status

        Tech Suggestion: FastAPI + WebSocket + PostgreSQL + Kafka

🪄 4. Notification Service

        Real-time and email notifications

        Triggers on:

        Message mentions (@name)

        Replies to threads

        Channel invites

        Kafka consumer
        Tech Suggestion: Express.js + Kafka + Mailgun / SES API

🧺 5. File Upload Service

        Upload and share media/documents

        Deduplication using file hash

        Stores to AWS S3

        Returns public/private file URLs

        Tech Suggestion: FastAPI + S3 + Hashlib (SHA256) + PostgreSQL

🔍 6. Search Service

        Full-text search on messages

        Search by user, channel, or keyword

        ElasticSearch + Kafka event consumer

        Tech Suggestion: ElasticSearch + FastAPI consumer

📣 7. API Gateway

        Unified entry point for frontend

        Load balancing, routing, rate limiting

        Can log & forward requests to services

        Tech Suggestion: NGINX

📜 8. Audit Logging Service

        Logs every major user action as event

        Kafka consumer that stores logs

        Useful for admin panel and analytics

        Tech Suggestion: Simple Python Kafka consumer + PostgreSQL
